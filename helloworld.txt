I googled Github Tutorial and this nice little tutorial
from Hubspot came up.
https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners
This Hubspot tutorial asks me to use CLI git commands.
I was able to execute almost all of them except
git push -u origin master.

I kept failing on autentication even after I created 2
new personal access tokens, copied them, and update my
key chain.  I also tried to past the token into the
password prompt in the terminal.  I suspect this is what's
failing.  I just don't know how to use terminal on Mac.
That said, there is no help terminal help topic to educate me.

Meanwhile, GitHub keeps prompting me to use their git CLI app.
I tried to install it
brew install gh

The brew install failed because of permissions on /usr/local/bin
I tried to chown the permissions, but that failed too.  I suspect
Cisco wants my root directories locked down.

My workaround was just to use GitHub Desktop for push, branch,
commit, and merge commands.  That seemed to work fine.

Time to move on and clone the SONiC repo.  Let's go baby!
